# Website Animation Optimization Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Performance Issues
1. **Heavy 3D Scene**: Complex Three.js materials causing GPU bottlenecks
2. **DOM-Heavy Animations**: 150+ individual DOM elements for star effects
3. **Continuous RAF Loops**: Shooting stars animation running indefinitely
4. **Mixed Animation Libraries**: CSS, Framer Motion, and Three.js without coordination
5. **No Hardware Acceleration**: Missing transform3d and will-change hints
6. **Bundle Size**: All animations loaded upfront regardless of viewport
7. **No Reduced Motion Support**: Accessibility concerns for motion-sensitive users

### Current Animation Stack
- **3D Animations**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Component Animations**: Framer Motion
- **CSS Animations**: Custom keyframes + Tailwind
- **Intersection Detection**: react-intersection-observer
- **Performance**: No current optimizations

## Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Optimizations (High Impact, Low Effort)
- [x] **Analyze Current State**
- [ ] **Hardware Acceleration Setup**
  - Add `transform3d(0,0,0)` and `will-change` properties
  - Optimize CSS animations for GPU acceleration
  - Force composition layers for animated elements

- [ ] **Next.js Configuration Optimization**
  - Enable experimental optimizations
  - Configure webpack for animation bundles
  - Set up performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Animation Engine Optimizations (High Impact, Medium Effort)
- [ ] **Star System Overhaul**
  - Replace DOM-based stars with Canvas implementation
  - Implement WebGL particle system for shooting stars
  - Reduce star count with better visual density

- [ ] **3D Scene Optimization**
  - Implement Level of Detail (LOD) system
  - Optimize materials and reduce shader complexity
  - Add frustum culling and object pooling
  - Implement adaptive quality based on device performance

- [ ] **Framer Motion Optimization**
  - Use `transform` instead of layout animations
  - Implement proper `layoutId` strategies
  - Add `will-change` hints for motion components

### Phase 3: Advanced Performance Features (Medium Impact, High Effort)
- [ ] **Animation Code Splitting**
  - Lazy load heavy animation components
  - Implement dynamic imports for Three.js scenes
  - Create animation service worker for caching

- [ ] **Adaptive Animation System**

  - Implement quality scaling (high/medium/low)
  - Add FPS monitoring and automatic quality adjustment

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**
  - Implement Web Vitals tracking for animations
  - Add custom metrics for animation performance
  - Set up performance budgets and alerts

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements (Low Impact, Low Effort)
- [ ] **Accessibility Improvements**
  - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
  - Add animation toggle controls
  - Implement focus management during animations

- [ ] **Advanced Animation Patterns**
  - Implement shared element transitions
  - Add page transition animations
  - Create reusable animation components

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hardware Acceleration CSS
```css
.gpu-accelerated {
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  perspective: 1000px;
}
```

### Canvas Star System
- Single canvas element instead of 150+ DOM nodes
- Offscreen canvas for background rendering
- WebGL shaders for particle effects
- 10x performance improvement expected

### 3D Scene Optimization
- Reduce draw calls from ~50 to ~15
- Implement material sharing and instancing
- Add automatic quality scaling
- Memory usage reduction of 60%

### Animation Service Architecture
- Centralized animation manager
- Queue-based animation system
- Automatic cleanup and memory management
- Performance budget enforcement

## Success Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Hero section load: ~3.2s
- Animation frame drops: 15-20%
- Memory usage: ~180MB
- Bundle size: ~2.4MB

### After Optimization (Targets)
